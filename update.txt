Planned Approach Timeline
  - visualization
  - dynamics
  - default agent
  - full state deterministic MDP
  - limited observation horizon
  - uncertainty in position, velocity of other agents
  - uncertainty in position, velocity of self
  - complex adverserial policies

Strategies
  - MPC
  - Kalman-Bucy filter
  - LQG
  - RL
    + MCTS, online methods in general
    + Alpha vectors
  - Deep RL (online ML)
